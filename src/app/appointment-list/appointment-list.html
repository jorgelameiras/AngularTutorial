<!--
This is an example of One-Way Data Binding
the appointment variable which is called property is decalred and listed in the
appointement typescript file

If we declare a Appointment varaible in the ts file we can reference them like such

<p>{{appointment.id}}</p>
<p>{{appointment.title}}</p>
<p>{{appointment.date}}</p>

-->

<!--
Now we are creating the input fields for the user to enter the information
about their appointment. We can do this here or in TypeScript does not matter 

This is an example of two-way data binding 
-->


<div>
    <input [(ngModel)]="newAppointmentTitle" placeholder="Appointment description">
    <input [(ngModel)]="newAppointmentDate" type="date" placeholder="Appointment date">
    <!--
    Here below we are adding the fuction we created in "appointment-list.ts" to 
    perform whatever we want when the button click because we specified that beloww
    -->
    <button (click)="addApointment() ">Add</button>
</div>

<ul>
    <!--
    We want to have the freemdom to create many items, therefore, we will make use of Angular
    feature to create a loop for this list
    -->
    <li *ngFor="let appointment of appointments; index as i">
        <!--                                      Here we are pipping this data to match our style-->
        {{appointment.title}} {{appointment.date | date:'dd.MM.yyyy'}}
        <button (click)="deleteAppointment(i)">Delete</button>
    </li>
</ul>
